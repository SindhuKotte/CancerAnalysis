# Breast Cancer Tumor Classification and Feature Analysis
This project involves the analysis of a breast cancer dataset to classify tumors as either benign or malignant based on various tumor characteristics. The primary objective is to explore and visualize key features such as mean radius, texture, and area, and build a classification model for tumor type prediction.

## Project Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of multiple features that describe the properties of breast cancer tumors. By performing data analysis, visualization, and classification, we aim to identify significant patterns in the dataset and build an efficient model to classify tumors accurately.

## Key Features Analyzed:
Radius: The radius of the tumor

Texture: The texture of the tumor (e.g., smoothness)

Area: The area of the tumor

Perimeter: The perimeter of the tumor

Other statistical features describing the tumor's size, shape, and texture.

## Techniques and Tools Used:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical data

Visualization: Utilized histograms, boxplots, violin plots, and pairplots for feature analysis

Correlation Analysis: Identified the relationships between key features and tumor classification

Classification Model: Built a classification model to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors using Scikit-learn

Performance Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using ROC curves and accuracy metrics

## Technologies:
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Data Visualization: Histograms, Boxplots, Violin Plots, Correlation Heatmaps

Modeling: Logistic Regression or other classifiers
